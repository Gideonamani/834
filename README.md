# Aircraft Maintenace Eng. СПБ ГУГА Group 834 SEM7-F16

##Short Intro
As part of an experiment, I'll try to see if incorporating Github with day to day studies will be of great help to the organisation of materials and lecture notes in such a manner that it easier for anyone to revise and locate a certain topic taught at a particular date.
Why?
Because in an age where technology is becoming more and more a part of everyday life. Education and the learning process should be made more seamless, collective and shareable.
